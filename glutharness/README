Running instructions:
On Ubuntu (Linux Mint, in my case)
To run my code, enter the "linux" directory and type "make".  Then, from the same directory, type "./glutharness".
To close the window, press 'q' or 'Q'
To change the color of the display, press 'c' or 'C'

What I implemented (EXTRA CREDIT):
My code has all the required functionality, plus the first two extra credit pieces: "Implement application based
color variable" and "Implement a method where the keyboard is used to change the color".  To test, run the program
and press 'c' or 'C'
